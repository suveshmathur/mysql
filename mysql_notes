MYISAM : key cache. It only caches index pages from .MYI files. (key_buffer_size)

InnoDB : InnoDB Buffer Pool. It caches data and index pages from InnoDB tables accessed.(innodb_buffer_pool_size)

innodb_log_file_size= 25% of innodb_buffer_pool_size or 2047M, whichever is smaller.

InnoDB offers:
ACID transactions
row-level locking
foreign key constraints
automatic crash recovery
table compression (read/write)
spatial data types (no spatial indexes)
No Full text search/index
InnoDB stores both data and indexes in one file. InnoDB uses a buffer pool to cache both data and indexes.

MyISAM offers:
fast COUNT(*)s (when WHERE, GROUP BY, or JOIN is not used)
full text indexing (update: supported in InnoDB from MySQL 5.6)
smaller disk footprint
very high table compression (read only)
spatial data types and indexes (R-tree) (update: supported in InnoDB from MySQL 5.7)

MyISAM has table-level locking, but no row-level locking. 
No transactions. No automatic crash recovery, but it does offer repair table functionality. 
No foreign key constraints. 
MyISAM tables are generally more compact in size on disk when compared to InnoDB tables. 
MyISAM tables could be further highly reduced in size by compressing with myisampack if needed, but become read-only. 
MyISAM stores indexes in one file and data in another. 
MyISAM uses key buffers for caching indexes and leaves the data caching management to the operating system.
